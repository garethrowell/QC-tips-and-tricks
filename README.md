# QC-tips-and-tricks

QCing data is tedious, but it shouldn't be difficult.

This is a small collection of *very* simple techniques for QC'ing data using R tidyverse. These are based on simple methods used to tame big datasets in SQL and relational databases. Most "tidy" datasets are, in fact, true sets in the mathematical sense. The requirement for a true set is that every record is unique. Set operations are the basis of SQL and relational databases. With the development of tidyverse grammar, you can use these set operations to quickly tame virtually any dataframe.

The main operations for QC'ing data are listed here have both SQL and R tidyverse equivalents: select(), distinct(),
